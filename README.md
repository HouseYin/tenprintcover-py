Based on: [10 PRINT "BOOK COVER" for Processing]

Processing-based book cover-generating algorithm based on [10PRINT](http://10print.org/). Artwork is inspired by the symbols found on the [Commodore PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET) keyboard: ![Commodore PET keyboard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/PET_Keyboard.svg)

#### Requirements
Runs on Python 3.x.

Requires Python bindings for [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) installed. While [pycairo](http://cairographics.org/pycairo/) should work but is outdated, the tool currently uses [cairocffi](https://github.com/SimonSapin/cairocffi).
